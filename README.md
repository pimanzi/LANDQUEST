# LANDQUEST

## OVERVIEW

 LandQuest is a dynamic platform designed to connect land buyers and sellers in Rwanda. This project aims to address the challenges of urbanization faced across Africa by providing a streamlined solution for land transactions.

## Why LandQuest?
Urbanization has led to overcrowded capital cities, making it difficult for individuals to find available land. LandQuest was developed to alleviate these issues by offering a user-friendly interface where users can view and purchase land, while sellers can easily list their properties. This platform promotes better land distribution and helps reduce the strain on urban centers.
